to make it work discord-rpc-w32.dll has to be in the same folder as celeste.exe

This version crash the app when you quit out of it.
Probably because DiscordRpc isn't shutdown properly.

This is all spag and I dont know what im doing.
But it's kinda working :)

Feel free to use this however you like it.
