# CelesteRichPresence
to make it work you got to build the Celeste.Mod.mm because i changed the Level.cs and player.cs a little bit
also discord-rpc-w32.dll has to be in the same folder as celeste.exe

This version crash the app when you quit out of it.
Probably because I didn't give a disconectCallback handler on my DiscordRpc class.

Also i curently hook the death counter to Player.Update because I dont know how to hook it to Player.Die

This is all spag and I dont know what im doing.
But it's kinda working :)

Feel free to use this however you like it.
