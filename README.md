This version crash the app when you quit out of it. Probably because I didn't give a disconectCallback handler on my DiscordRpc class. Also i curently hook the death counter to Player.Update because I dont know how to hook it to Player.Die  This is all spag and I dont know what im doing.  But it's kinda working :)
